# React Routers
React Router is a popular library for handling client-side routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages without requiring a full page reload, creating a seamless and dynamic user experience.

React Router and Tailwind CSS work together to create seamless navigation and beautifully styled user interfaces in React applications.

✅ Client-Side Routing – React Router enables dynamic navigation without page reloads.
✅ Utility-First Styling – Tailwind CSS provides pre-defined classes for quick and responsive designs.
✅ Component-Based Routing – Define routes using <Routes> and <Route> components.
✅ Styled Navigation – Use <Link> or <NavLink> with Tailwind classes for active states, hover effects, and transitions.
